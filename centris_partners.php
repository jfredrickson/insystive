                <p>HumanAPI is an API for human health data that allows users to easily collect, normalize and share their data across a variety of applications. Their API service allows an application developer to easily connect multiple data sources relevant to their application by embedding code directly into their authentication flow. This, in turn, allows a user to much more seamlessly connect and share their health data (from a wide variety of sources) directly with that application, enriching their experience. Their authentication flow embeds itself seamlessly into any application, ensuring that the user does not have to leave the experience they are accustomed to.</p>
