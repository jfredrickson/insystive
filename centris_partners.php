            <h2>HumanAPI</h2>

            <p>HumanAPI is an API for human health data that allows users to easily collect, normalize and share their data across a variety of applications.</p>
            <p>Their API service allows an application developer to easily connect multiple data sources relevant to their application by embedding code directly into their authentication flow. This, in turn, allows a user to much more seamlessly connect and share their health data (from a wide variety of sources) directly with that application, enriching their experience.</p>
            <p>Their authentication flow embeds itself seamlessly into any application, ensuring that the user does not have to leave the experience they are accustomed to.</p>
            <p>Check out <a href="http://www.humanapi.co/">www.humanapi.co</a> for more information.</p>
