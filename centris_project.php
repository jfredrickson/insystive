              <p class="lead">In healthcare, independence is achieved by connecting real-time patient data (not just health records) to the people who need it most.  Although CentrIS can also be used for enterprise IT systems, it is initially being developed for the individual consumer.</p>
              <p class="lead">CentrIS will offer safe, independent living for those managing aging, chronic disease or disability. We do this by connecting our customers medical device information with their caregivers or loved ones.</p>

              <p class="lead">Our system offers real-time, vendor-neutral communication between patients, devices and caregivers.</p>
              <p class="lead">At Insystive, we don’t believe consumers should have to choose between cutting edge medical devices and cutting edge communications.  That’s why we have focused on making connecting existing devices in more useful ways.</p>
              <p class="lead">With CentrIS, Insystive is building an ecosystem of medical devices that puts the power of real-time health data in the hands of those who need it most.</p>
